Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), otherwise also known as Bluetooth Smart, is a variant of the Bluetooth system, where it is designed to have a wireless network range that is comparable to the regular Bluetooth system, yet being more efficient in both its power consumption levels as well as being cheaper to develop as well. BLE is primarily used for short range, infrequent data transmissions with other devices which allows it to be powered by very small batteries for an extended period of time. As such, Bluetooth Low Energy is often incorporated into small embedded devices that make up the internet of things, all due to the above mentioned advantages. With that being said, Bluetooth Low Energy is not without its own flaws, as it comes attached with its own set of security vulnerabilities that have been exploited by others to force BLE devices to perform functions that are unacceptable under normal circumstances.
